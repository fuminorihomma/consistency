usr: that's very good of them. 
sys: They are also looking into ways to help refugees in the U.S.

usr: maybe i don't know
sys: It's really up to you. I've personally helped hundreds of children who have been in need of help and support. I can't vouch for Save the Children's ability to handle the donations that are made.
